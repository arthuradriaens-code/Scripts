“I liken starting one’s computing career with Unix, say as an under-
graduate, to being born in East Africa. It is intolerably hot, your
body is covered with lice and flies, you are malnourished and you
suffer from numerous curable diseases. But, as far as young East

within it. By the time they find out differently, it is too late. They
already think that the writing of shell scripts is a natural act.”
— Ken Pier, Xerox PARC

“The wonderful thing about standards is that there are so many of
